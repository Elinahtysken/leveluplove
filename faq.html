<!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">
    <h3>How do you match participants for your events?</h3>
    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>We focus on compatibility and shared values. Before each event, participants fill out a questionnaire about interests, goals, and what they’re looking for in a partner. This helps us put together groups where people are genuinely on the same page in life.</p>
    <p>It’s not about algorithms or surface-level traits, but about creating the best chances for real conversations and meaningful connections.</p>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">
    <h3>What criteria do you use to select participants for speed dating events?</h3>
    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>We welcome singles who are serious about finding a relationship and who have their lives in order. Typically this means people with stable careers, a healthy lifestyle, and the emotional maturity to build something lasting. In short: people who know what they want and are ready to meet someone who adds to their life.</p>
    <p>This makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone — and increases the chances that you’ll meet someone truly compatible.</p>

  <div class="faq-question">
    <h3>How do you choose your event venues?</h3>
    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>The setting really matters. We choose venues that are comfortable, easy to talk in, and create the right mood for connection. Think relaxed, stylish, and intimate rather than loud or overcrowded. The goal is for you to feel at ease so conversations can flow naturally.</p>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">
    <h3>What can I expect during a Tête-à-tête event?</h3>
    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Our events are designed to be more personal than standard speed dating. You can expect a mix of one-on-one conversations, light activities to break the ice, and enough time to actually get to know each person. The format is structured but still relaxed, so you won’t feel rushed.</p>
    <p>There will of course be drinks and bites to keep the atmosphere casual and enjoyable. After the event, we handle the follow-up discreetly so you only connect with people you’ve both shown interest in.</p>
