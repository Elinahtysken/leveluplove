                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our matching process is built on the principle of compatibility and shared values. During the selection phase, all participants complete a comprehensive questionnaire covering their interests, life goals, values, and relationship expectations. We believe in the similarity principle - that successful couples share fundamental commonalities in their outlook on life, ambitions, and core values.</p>
                    <p>Our experienced team carefully analyzes these responses to curate each event with participants who have genuine potential for meaningful connections. We don't just match based on superficial preferences, but on deeper compatibility factors that form the foundation of lasting relationships.</p>
